As a graduate student at the University of Toronto's Masters of Biotechnology (MBiotech) program, I can attest to the unique benefits that come with studying in this program. I chose the Digital Health Technologies (DHT) stream because I wanted to expand my knowledge in coding and data analysis within a health context. Here's what I've learned and experienced after one year in the program.

## Differences between DHT and BioPharm Streams
While the Biopharmaceutical stream focuses on courses like Molecular Biology and Genetics, the DHT stream puts a greater emphasis on coding, data science, and statistics. The BioPharm stream also starts internships earlier, after eight months of study, while DHT students start their internships after one year. However, there are some courses shared by both streams, such as BioPartnering, Effective Management, and Fundamentals of Business.

## DHT-Specific Courses
One of the courses I found most useful was Special Topics in Biomedical Communications. In this course, we learned about the basics of coding in R, such as loops and if-else statements, which was helpful even for students who already had programming knowledge from their undergraduate studies or were self-taught. I also found Data Science I and II, which focus on statistical theory and foundations, to be content-heavy but highly useful. Another course I enjoyed was Tableau/Data Visualization, which provided an overview of dashboard development in Tableau and making useful representations of data. Finally, I took an optional course on Deep Learning, which was helpful for learning about neural networks.

## Benefits of the MBiotech Program
One of the best parts of the MBiotech program is its small size, which allows you to get to know your peers and professors closely. For instance, when I took the Deep Learning elective, there were only three other students in the class, so we got to collaborate closely. Additionally, the program offers opportunities to work with companies through competitions, which can provide cash prizes and recognition for your work. For example, I worked in a team for a marketing competition offered by Jazz Pharmaceuticals, where we won top prize. We also participated in a Data Science competition and received a Top 3 designation out of 50 competing teams.

Perhaps the most valuable aspect of the MBiotech program is the one-year internship experience that is part of your Masterâ€™s coursework. This internship can be in established pharmaceutical companies or biotech start-ups and can include roles in data science, business, or digital initiatives, depending on your interests. I had the opportunity to interview with several organizations and ultimately accepted my top offer, which was an amazing experience.

## Conclusion
Overall, I highly recommend the MBiotech program to anyone interested in working at the intersection of technology and health. Whether you're in the DHT or BioPharm stream, you'll have access to unique courses, opportunities to work with companies, and a one-year internship experience that can set you up for success in the biopharmaceutical sector.
